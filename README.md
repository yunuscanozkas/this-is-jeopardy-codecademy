MACHINE LEARNING AND AI FUNDAMENTALS | This Is Jeopardy!
# Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

# Project Goals
You will work to write several functions that investigate a dataset of Jeopardy! questions and answers. Filter the dataset for topics that you’re interested in, compute the average difficulty of those questions, and train to become the next Jeopardy champion!
